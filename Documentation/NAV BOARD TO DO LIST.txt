Download gitingore from google drive and repalce the old one.
Clean up the repository.
rename to navboard hardware
delete the bad gps library
Make project librays for all libraries
text file renamed to documntation folder
Gerbs will go into the gerb folder

Schematic:

make capacitors to nopolarized or to C7/ Csmall//
Power flags pointing up and ground flags are pointing down//
clean up wireing//
less grid space between components//
make the R2 to 500 Ohms//
mirror command on the IMU//
change font size of text a little larger//
Connect the the dotted lines//
	Connections:IMU  indicators: Power LED
Move LiDAR//
RX7 should be an output//
rename RX7 to TivaRX and //
serial7 by The RX7//
Text about the of what the gps is//
use European resistor symbols//
move the D1 closer to the diode//
Move the backup battery into the GPS block//
5 volt flag on the indicator//
Center X9:C1 by 1 space//
TX7: pc5//
RX7: PC4//
Intgs are outputs on the outputs//
Delete 1PPS//
Repalce LED Defualt LED//
Add Red LED for an Error signal connected to a Digitial input/output//
led on the sda for lidar and off board IMU and Add led to gps rx(yellow)//
Pin ll on gps name wire EXAnt//
NO oki instead AP1509: 5 Volt, specify on slik screen that it is 5 volts//
LiDAR
Test LiDAR sensor as soon as possible


PCB Board Layout:
High level placement placed at anything divisable by 10//
Line up the parts to the grid//
fix the silk screen
Line up the leds with the resistors//
fix all the diagonals to not diagnoals//
reasign all components to 0603 //
bring the components closer to its parent Module//
play around with the traces and component placement//
work on the Title Card
Move the text closer to its componentes//
Make sexy polygons
