LiDAR capacitor is backwards on layout
	also make it a polar cap in shcematic
we're sending 5V to the LiDAR I2C pins through the pullup resistors. those should go to 3.3V


LiDAR might need an ATmega in the board to communicate correctly.
ATmega might need an external 16MHz clock to communicate with the TIVA over 115200 baud which is the current rate.
